Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Tord Åke Larsson, a front-end developer from a small town in the far north. Drawing inspiration from the remote icy enclave and the serene beauty of the Northern lights, I strive to create web experiences that seamlessly blend elegance and innovation.

### Background

I'm a survivor of the Icy River of Børselv, my family name on my mothers side is Balto, like the sled dog Balto. This unique perspective drives my passion for crafting digital realms that captivate and inspire.

### Technical Skills

- **JavaScript**
- **CSS**
- **User Experience (UX) Design**
- **WordPress**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **HTML**

### Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/lordaake/Gamehub-website): My first website ever. A website that should resemble a shop.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/lordaake/Semester-Project-Finished): Community Science Museum. My second website ever. It should resemble a science museum website.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-lordaake): Mango Quest. My third website ever. A blog about a group of adventureres who travel the world in search of mangoes.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to connect with me. I'm always eager to collaborate on new and exciting projects.
